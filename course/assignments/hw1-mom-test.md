# HW1: Mom Test Interviews + User Stories

**Weight:** 4% of final grade
**Due:** Week 2

## Objective

Learn to validate ideas through proper user research before building.

## Tasks

1. **Identify a personal problem worth solving** (for Project 1)
2. **Conduct 3 "Mom Test" interviews** with potential users
3. **Write interview summaries** (anonymized)
4. **Create 5-8 user stories** based on findings
5. **Prioritize using MoSCoW method**
6. **Write initial PRD** (1-2 pages)

## The Mom Test Principles

The Mom Test (by Rob Fitzpatrick) teaches you to get honest feedback by:
- Talking about their life, not your idea
- Asking about specifics in the past, not generics about the future
- Talking less, listening more

**Bad questions:**
- "Would you use this app?"
- "Do you think this is a good idea?"

**Good questions:**
- "Tell me about the last time you had this problem..."
- "What did you do to solve it?"
- "How much did that cost you (time/money/frustration)?"

## Deliverables

1. **Interview notes document** - 3 interviews, anonymized
2. **User stories** - Proper format: "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
3. **Prioritization** - MoSCoW (Must/Should/Could/Won't) with justification
4. **PRD draft** - 1-2 pages covering problem, solution, target users
