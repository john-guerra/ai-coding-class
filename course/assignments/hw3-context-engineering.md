# HW3: Context Engineering Lab

**Weight:** 4% of final grade
**Due:** Week 7

## Objective

Learn to optimize AI context for better code generation through `.cursorrules` and context management.

## Setup

**Provided:** Messy codebase (~20 files, various patterns)

The codebase will have:
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Mixed coding styles
- Various patterns used
- Some technical debt

## Tasks

### 1. Analyze Codebase (25%)
- Identify coding patterns and conventions
- Document architecture decisions
- Note inconsistencies and technical debt
- Understand the existing structure

### 2. Create `.cursorrules` File (35%)
Build a comprehensive rules file including:
- Coding standards
- Architecture patterns
- Naming conventions
- Do's and don'ts
- Technology stack guidelines
- File organization rules

### 3. Test Context (25%)
- Add a feature **WITHOUT** rules active
- Add the same feature **WITH** rules active
- Compare quality of generated code
- Document differences

### 4. Optimize (15%)
- Refine rules based on test results
- Test again
- Document improvements
- Create final version

## Deliverables

1. **Codebase analysis document** - Patterns, issues, architecture
2. **`.cursorrules` file** - Well-commented, comprehensive
3. **Before/after code comparison** - Same feature, different contexts
4. **2-3 page report** - "How context engineering improved results"
5. **Best practices guide** - For context optimization
