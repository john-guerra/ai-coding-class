# HW3: Context Engineering — Rules & Process for Your P2 Project

**Weight:** 4% of final grade
**Due:** Week 8

## Objective

Set up your P2 project for AI-assisted development by creating effective rules files and an Agile workflow. You'll bridge the gap between your PRD/mockups (Claude Web, Weeks 3-5) and IDE-centric development (Weeks 6+) by creating instructions that help your AI tools understand your project, follow Scrum practices, and start from your existing designs.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this assignment, you should have:
- A PRD (from P1/P2 planning) with user stories and acceptance criteria
- At least one mockup or prototype (from Claude Web Artifacts or Figma)
- Your P2 repository created on GitHub
- Antigravity (or equivalent IDE AI tool) installed

## Tasks

### 1. Set Up Scrum Workflow on GitHub (25%)

Create a professional Agile workflow using GitHub Issues and Projects:

- **Create a GitHub Project board** (Board layout) with columns: Backlog, Sprint Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done
- **Create milestones** for Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 (with due dates matching your P2 timeline)
- **Break your PRD into GitHub Issues** — Turn each user story into one or more issues with:
  - Clear title (action-oriented)
  - Acceptance criteria as a checklist in the issue body
  - Labels (`feature`, `bug`, `chore`, `docs`, priority labels)
  - Milestone assignment (Sprint 1 or Sprint 2)
- **Create at least 10 issues** across your two sprints
- **Assign Sprint 1 issues** to the "Sprint Todo" column

### 2. Create Rules / Instructions Files (35%)

Create a comprehensive `.antigravityrules` (or `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursorrules`) file for your P2 project that includes:

**Project Context:**
- Tech stack and versions
- Architecture overview (folder structure, key patterns)
- Naming conventions and coding standards
- Testing strategy (framework, patterns, coverage goals)

**PRD & Design References:**
- Link or reference to your PRD document
- Description of your mockup/prototype designs
- Key UI components and their expected behavior
- User flow descriptions that the AI should follow when implementing features

**Scrum & Workflow Instructions:**
- Branch naming convention (e.g., `feature/42-description`)
- Commit message format
- PR workflow (link to issues, required reviews)
- How to reference GitHub Issues in code and commits

**Do's and Don'ts:**
- Patterns to follow and patterns to avoid
- Dependencies and libraries to prefer
- Security and accessibility requirements

### 3. Test Your Rules with a Real Feature (25%)

Demonstrate that your rules file makes a measurable difference:

1. **Pick one feature** from your Sprint 1 backlog (a GitHub Issue)
2. **Implement it WITHOUT rules active** — Start a fresh chat, disable or remove the rules file, and ask the AI to implement the feature based on a brief description only
3. **Implement it WITH rules active** — Same feature, clean start, but with your rules file in place and referencing your PRD/mockups
4. **Compare the results** — Document specific differences in:
   - Code quality and consistency with your project patterns
   - How well the AI understood the design/mockup intent
   - Adherence to your naming conventions and architecture
   - Quality of tests generated

### 4. Refine and Document (15%)

- Iterate on your rules file based on the test results
- Document what worked, what didn't, and what you changed
- Write a brief reflection (1-2 pages) covering:
  - How your rules file bridges PRD/mockups to implementation
  - How the Scrum setup on GitHub helps organize AI-assisted development
  - What you would add or change for Sprint 2

## Deliverables

Submit to Canvas:

1. **GitHub repository link** — With Project board, milestones, issues, and rules file visible
2. **Rules file** (`.antigravityrules` or equivalent) — In the project root, well-commented
3. **Before/after comparison** — Screenshots or code snippets showing the same feature implemented with and without rules
4. **Reflection document** (1-2 pages) — What you learned about context engineering for your own project

## Rubric (40 points)
