# HW4: Claude Code Workflow & TDD

**Weight:** 5% of final grade
**Due:** Week 11

## Objective

Demonstrate mastery of the Claude Code development workflow by setting up a project, using the Explore→Plan→Implement→Commit pattern, and doing TDD through Claude Code.

## Part 1: Claude Code Project Setup (25%)

Set up Claude Code for your P3 project:
- Write a comprehensive CLAUDE.md (project context, stack, conventions, do's/don'ts)
- Configure permissions (allowlists or sandboxing)
- Demonstrate `/init` output and iterate on CLAUDE.md based on it
- Show context management strategy (`/clear`, `/compact`, `--continue`)

**Requirements:**
- CLAUDE.md must include: tech stack, architecture decisions, coding conventions, testing strategy, and project-specific do's/don'ts
- At least one @import reference to additional context (e.g., PRD, API docs)

## Part 2: Explore → Plan → Implement → Commit (30%)

Use Claude Code's recommended 4-phase workflow on a real P3 feature:
- **Explore:** Use Glob, Grep, Read to understand existing code
- **Plan:** Use Plan mode to design the approach
- **Implement:** Execute the plan with Claude Code
- **Commit:** Create clean commits with meaningful messages

**Requirements:**
- Git history must clearly show this workflow
- At least 3 commits demonstrating the pattern

## Part 3: TDD with Claude Code (30%)

Build a P3 feature using strict TDD through Claude Code:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Have Claude Code implement minimum code to pass
3. Refactor
4. Repeat for all acceptance criteria

**Requirements:**
- Tests written BEFORE implementation
- Git history shows red-green-refactor commits
- Clear commit messages showing TDD process

## Part 4: Reflection (15%)

Write a 1-2 page reflection answering:
- How does the Explore→Plan→Implement→Commit workflow compare to your previous approach?
- What context management strategies worked best?
- Include annotated Claude Code session log showing your workflow

## Deliverables

1. **P3 repository** with CLAUDE.md and permissions configuration
2. **Feature code** with TDD git history (red-green-refactor commits)
3. **Annotated Claude Code session log**
4. **Reflection document** (1-2 pages)

## Rubric (50 points)

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| CLAUDE.md & project setup | 25% |
| Explore→Plan→Implement→Commit workflow | 30% |
| TDD process through Claude Code | 30% |
| Reflection & session log | 15% |
