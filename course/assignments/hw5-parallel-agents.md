# HW5: Parallel Agent Orchestration

**Weight:** 4% of final grade
**Due:** Week 14

## Objective

Master coordinating multiple AI agents for complex tasks through parallel execution.

## Example Feature

**"Add OAuth authentication with Google and GitHub"**

(You may choose a different feature of similar complexity)

## Phase 1: Planning (20%)

- Break feature into independent tasks
- Assign tasks to different "agents" (A, B, C, D)
- Define interfaces between components
- Create coordination strategy

**Example breakdown:**
- Agent A: Database schema + migrations
- Agent B: Backend API endpoints
- Agent C: Frontend components
- Agent D: Comprehensive test suite

## Phase 2: Parallel Execution (40%)

Run agents simultaneously using:
- Multiple Antigravity sessions, OR
- Multiple Claude Code instances, OR
- Different tools for different agents

**Requirements:**
- At least 3 agents running in parallel
- Clear separation of concerns
- Defined interfaces before starting
- Time tracking for each agent

## Phase 3: Integration (30%)

- Merge agent outputs
- Resolve conflicts
- Ensure consistency across components
- Test integrated system
- Fix any interface mismatches

## Phase 4: Retrospective (10%)

Answer:
- What worked well?
- What was challenging?
- How would you improve the process?
- Time savings vs. sequential approach?

## Deliverables

1. **Task breakdown document** - How you divided the work
2. **Prompts for each agent** - What you gave each agent
3. **Integration strategy** - How you planned to merge
4. **Git history** - Showing parallel work (branches)
5. **Working integrated feature** - Everything merged and functional
6. **Retrospective document** - Lessons learned
