# Project 1: Personal Utility App

**Weight:** 15% of final grade
**Due:** Week 6

## Objective

Master one AI modality while building a real solution to a validated problem.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Solves a validated real problem (Mom Test interviews)
- 5+ user stories with CRUD operations
- Data persistence
- Responsive design (mobile + desktop)

### Technical Requirements
- **ONE primary modality focus** (Claude Web, Antigravity, or Claude Code)
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Simple tech stack (vanilla JS or React)
- 50%+ test coverage
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (lint + test + deploy)
- Deployed and publicly accessible

### Documentation Requirements
- README (problem, solution, setup, tech stack, AI usage)
- User stories document
- 5-minute demo video
- 500-word reflection

## Deliverables

1. GitHub repository
2. Deployed app URL
3. Demo video (YouTube/Loom)
4. Reflection document
