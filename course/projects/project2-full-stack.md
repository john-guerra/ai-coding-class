# Project 2: Full-Stack Application

**Weight:** 20% of final grade
**Due:** Week 10

## Objective

Integrate multiple AI modalities with professional engineering practices to build a complete full-stack application as a pair.

## Team Structure

- **P2 is a pair project** (2 students)
- Form pairs in **Week 6**, create a Canvas group by end of Week 6
- **One submission per pair** via Canvas group
- Both partners must have **meaningful commits** throughout the project
- Grades may be adjusted individually for unbalanced contributions (see Rubric)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Complete full-stack (frontend + backend + database)
- User authentication (JWT or OAuth)
- 3+ distinct features/roles
- Real-time updates OR complex state management
- Public API with documentation
- Professional UI/UX

### Technical Requirements

**AI Modalities:**
- Use all 3 modalities appropriately throughout development

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React/Next.js + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js/Express OR Next.js API routes
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Auth: JWT or OAuth

**Test-Driven Development:**
- 80%+ test coverage
- Unit + Integration + E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress)

**Evaluation Suite:**
- Automated test runs
- Code quality metrics
- Security scanning
- Performance benchmarks
- Custom semantic evals
- Eval dashboard

**Advanced CI/CD:**
- Multi-stage pipeline
- Deploy previews for PRs
- Coverage reporting (CodeCov)
- Security scanning in CI
- Automated deployment
- Environment management

### Pair Requirements

- **Shared GitHub repo** with both partners having push access
- **Shared rules file** (`.antigravityrules` or equivalent) maintained by both partners
- **Branch-per-issue workflow** -- PRs reviewed by partner before merge
- **Minimum 5 PR reviews per partner** (visible in GitHub)
- Both partners must have **substantial commit history** (no single-partner projects)
- **Document at least 2 pair programming sessions** (date, duration, what you worked on)

### Agile Process
- 2+ documented sprints
- Sprint planning done jointly (both partners)
- Partner standups (at least 3 per sprint from each partner)
- Sprint retrospectives including partner feedback
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Task estimation

### Documentation Requirements
- Comprehensive README
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Architecture diagram
- Database schema diagram
- Setup/deployment guide
- Sprint retrospectives
- 10-minute demo video
- Partner contribution log (who did what)
- Individual 300-word reflection from each partner (separate submissions)

## Deliverables

1. GitHub repository (with visible commit history from both partners)
2. Deployed app (production URL)
3. Eval dashboard (live or screenshots)
4. Complete documentation package
5. Demo video
6. Individual reflections (one per partner, submitted separately)

## Rubric (200 points)

| Category | Points | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Functionality** | 45 | Features complete, authentication working, API functional |
| **Technical Excellence** | 60 | Code quality, architecture, test coverage (80%+) |
| **AI Mastery** | 30 | Effective use of all 3 modalities |
| **CI/CD & DevOps** | 30 | Pipeline quality, deployment, monitoring |
| **Agile Process & Pair Workflow** | 20 | Sprint docs, pair standups, PR reviews, contribution balance |
| **Documentation** | 15 | README, API docs, reflections quality |

### Functionality Breakdown (45 pts)
- User authentication: 10 pts
- Core features (3+): 20 pts
- API quality: 10 pts
- UI/UX polish: 5 pts

### Technical Excellence Breakdown (60 pts)
- Code architecture: 20 pts
- Test coverage (80%+): 20 pts
- Database design: 10 pts
- Security practices: 10 pts

### CI/CD Breakdown (30 pts)
- Multi-stage pipeline: 10 pts
- Deploy previews: 5 pts
- Coverage reporting: 5 pts
- Security scanning: 5 pts
- Automated deployment: 5 pts

### Agile Process & Pair Workflow Breakdown (20 pts)
- Sprint planning & retros: 5 pts
- Partner standups (3+ per sprint each): 3 pts
- PR reviews (5+ per partner): 4 pts
- Contribution balance (both partners with substantial commits): 4 pts
- Pair programming sessions documented: 2 pts
- Shared rules file maintained: 2 pts

**Note:** Individual grades may be adjusted up to ±10% based on contribution balance. If commit history or PR reviews show significantly unbalanced work, the less-contributing partner's grade may be reduced.
