# Project 2: Full-Stack Application

**Weight:** 20% of final grade
**Due:** Week 12

## Objective

Integrate multiple AI modalities with professional engineering practices to build a complete full-stack application.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Complete full-stack (frontend + backend + database)
- User authentication (JWT or OAuth)
- 3+ distinct features/roles
- Real-time updates OR complex state management
- Public API with documentation
- Professional UI/UX

### Technical Requirements

**AI Modalities:**
- Use all 3 modalities appropriately throughout development

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React/Next.js + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js/Express OR Next.js API routes
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Auth: JWT or OAuth

**Test-Driven Development:**
- 80%+ test coverage
- Unit + Integration + E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress)

**Evaluation Suite:**
- Automated test runs
- Code quality metrics
- Security scanning
- Performance benchmarks
- Custom semantic evals
- Eval dashboard

**Advanced CI/CD:**
- Multi-stage pipeline
- Deploy previews for PRs
- Coverage reporting (CodeCov)
- Security scanning in CI
- Automated deployment
- Environment management

### Agile Process
- 2+ documented sprints
- Sprint planning documents
- Daily standup notes
- Sprint retrospectives
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Task estimation

### Documentation Requirements
- Comprehensive README
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Architecture diagram
- Database schema diagram
- Setup/deployment guide
- Sprint retrospectives
- 10-minute demo video
- 1500-word technical blog post

## Deliverables

1. GitHub repository
2. Deployed app (production URL)
3. Eval dashboard (live or screenshots)
4. Complete documentation package
5. Demo video
6. Technical blog post
