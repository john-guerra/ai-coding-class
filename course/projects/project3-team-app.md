# Project 3: Team Application with Advanced AI

**Weight:** 20% of final grade
**Due:** Week 15 (Demo Day)

## Objective

Build a production-grade application with advanced AI techniques as a team.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Complex, production-ready application
- Multiple user types with different capabilities
- Advanced features requiring sophisticated logic
- Real-world use case (Mom Test validated)
- Portfolio/interview-worthy quality

### Technical Requirements

**Advanced Architecture:**
- Microservices OR well-architected monolith
- Message queues or event-driven (if appropriate)
- Caching strategy (Redis or similar)
- API gateway or similar

**Parallel Agentic Programming:**
- 3+ features built with parallel agents
- Clear agent coordination strategy
- Documentation of agent workflow

**Comprehensive Evaluation System:**
- Multi-dimensional evals (correctness, quality, semantics, performance, security)
- LLM-as-judge implementation
- Historical metrics tracking
- Golden dataset of test cases
- Quantitative comparison of AI approaches

**Enterprise CI/CD:**
- Multi-environment (dev/staging/prod)
- Advanced deployment (canary OR blue-green)
- Performance gates (Lighthouse, bundle size)
- Automated security scanning (SAST/DAST)
- Database migrations in pipeline
- Automated rollback capability

**Production Monitoring:**
- Error tracking (Sentry or similar)
- Performance monitoring (APM)
- Uptime monitoring
- Log aggregation
- Alerting system

**Security:**
- Security audit passed
- Penetration testing performed
- OWASP top 10 addressed
- Secrets management
- Rate limiting

### Team Process
- 3+ sprints documented
- Team contract established
- Daily standups recorded
- Sprint planning & retrospectives
- Code review process
- Pair programming sessions
- Clear Git workflow (branches, PRs, reviews)
- Peer evaluations

### Documentation Requirements
- System architecture documentation
- API documentation (comprehensive)
- Database schema + ER diagrams
- Deployment guide
- Developer onboarding guide
- User guide
- All sprint retrospectives
- Team retrospective
- Individual reflections (each member)
- Technical blog post (team effort)
- 20-minute demo presentation

## Deliverables

1. GitHub organization with repositories
2. Deployed application (production)
3. Monitoring dashboard access
4. Eval system with historical data
5. Complete documentation package
6. Team presentation
7. Individual reflections
8. Technical blog post
